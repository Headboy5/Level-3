#Two modes of running Python:
#   Interactive Mode: Type commands directly into the interpreter and get immediate results.
#   Script Mode: Write code in a .py file and run the whole file at once.

#Difference between expression and statement:
#   Expression: Produces a value (e.g., 2 + 3)
#   Statement: Performs an action (e.g., print("Hello"), x = 5)

#Examples of each data type:
