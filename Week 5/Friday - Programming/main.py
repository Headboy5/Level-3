"""
What is a Syntax error and give three examples.
A Syntax error in programming occurs when the code written does not conform to the rules and structure of the programming language.
This prevents the code from being executed because the interpreter or compiler cannot understand it.
Syntax errors are typically identified during the parsing stage before the program runs.

Example 1: Missing colon at the end of a function definition
    # def foo()
    #     print("missing colon")

    # def foo():
    #     print("correct")

Example 2: Unmatched parentheses
    # print("Hello, World!"

    # print("Hello, World!")

Example 3: Incorrect indentation
    # def another_function():
    # print("This will cause an indentation error")

    # def another_function():
    #     print("This is correctly indented")
